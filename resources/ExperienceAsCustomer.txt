Our experience as the customer:

The code from our provider had a very neat GUI. Their GUI allows users to choose one of 6 options to modify an animation and based on the user’s options they can enable/disable different input text fields. It is much simpler than our design where we have many more textboxes and a button for each option to modify animation. We can use their design for a much more intuitive GUI. Our customer group petition to have OOD pass/fail so we didn’t get feedback from them about our design.

We had a moderate relationship with our provider. They replied and gave us the starter code in a prompt manner. However, when they gave us the code there were a lot of design problems and they didn’t mention them until we pointed them out. For instance, the biggest problem is their project can’t run input files and can only work with their JUnit test. The providers didn’t have the ability to fix this issue so we investigated ourselves. My partner and I analyzed their code and pinpointed the problem to their Animator Panel. To make our project work, we made a small change so Animator Panel will accept a Model instead of a Shape, and fixed the way how paintComponent() works. We recognize that this change should be done by the providers but due to the situation it was very hard to do so.
